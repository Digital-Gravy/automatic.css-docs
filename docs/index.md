# Welcome

Automatic.css (ACSS) is consistently voted the **#1 framework for WordPress page builders** because it combines innovative features, True Builder Integration™, best practices, unparalleled support, and education. It revolutionizes how you build websites with page builders, empowering developers and designers to create beautiful, consistent, and maintainable websites at unprecedented speed while maintaining complete control over their code.

When you choose ACSS, you're not just buying a CSS framework. You're buying true vision, an ecosystem, a vibrant community, a learning environment for web design best practices, unmatched support, and a brand new workflow that transforms how you work.

## What Makes Automatic.css Different

Most CSS frameworks try to do too much, lack flexibility, create limitations, and aren't designed for page builders. Automatic.css is different—it was designed from the ground up as a next-generation framework specifically for WordPress and page builder environments.

ACSS has all the typical benefits of a framework plus numerous additional benefits, with none of the downsides.

**Industry-Leading Innovations:**

Automatic.css pioneered numerous features that have become essential to modern WordPress development:

- UI dashboard for effortless framework customization with live preview & hot reload
- Automatic shade generation for colors
- Fluid responsive spacing and typography using mathematical scales
- Auto grids and intelligent layout systems
- Comprehensive accessibility features (focus styling, clickable parent, etc.)
- Variable partials and logical properties
- Header height offsets and smart spacing
- Contextual spacing and auto spacing
- Automatic color relationships and contextual colors
- Icon, Card, Border, Divider, and Texture frameworks
- Single-class form styling
- Auto-BEM methodology
- SCSS mixins and recipes for complex patterns
- Right-click contextual menus with live class preview
- And many more...

**Core Principles:**

- **No Sacrificing Creativity** – Most frameworks are too rigid and limiting. ACSS gives you complete freedom—there's no custom layout or feature you can't build and no design you can't match.
- **Balanced Approach** – ACSS doesn't do too little or too much. It's easy to learn and strikes the perfect balance between helping you and staying out of your way.
- **Speed AND Maintainability** – Build sites fast while maintaining unprecedented maintainability. ACSS ensures your sites are the most scalable and maintainable you've ever built.
- **Powerful Yet Lightweight** – Switch between full utility framework, ultra-minimal variable framework, or any combination. Easily disable features you don't need for zero bloat.
- **True Builder Integration™** – Works seamlessly across every layer of WordPress (FSE, Gutenberg, and third-party page builders) without upsells or add-ons.
- **Education & Excellence** – The average ACSS user improves their workflow and web design skills by multiple levels within months thanks to our culture of education, excellence, and support.

With 4.x, we made the difficult decision not to carry forward support for several integrations:

- **Cwicly** – Removed due to being EOL / discontinued.
- **Oxygen 4.x and 6.x** – Removed due to development concerns and workflow misalignment.
- **Breakdance** – Removed due to workflow misalignment.
- **GeneratePress & GenerateBlocks** – Removed due to workflow misalignment.
