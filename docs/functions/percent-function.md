title: percent() Function
sidebar_position: 100

**Note:** Functions and mixins are designed for use in the Custom SCSS area of the Automatic.css dashboard. They will not work in the builder inputs or builder CSS.

This function works exactly like the `rem()` function, but will convert the final value into a whole-number percentage value. It’s most often used with variable calculations.

```HTML
$my-percent: percent(5 * 5);
```

**Result:** 25%
