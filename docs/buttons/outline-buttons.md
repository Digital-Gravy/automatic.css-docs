You can turn any standard button into an outline button by using the class `.btn--outline`.

The `.btn--outline` class must be used in conjunction with `.btn--{color}` classes to control the button's color and `.btn--{size}` classes to change the button's text size.

**Note:** Outline variants must be enabled in the dashboard. Navigate to **Buttons & Links > Options** and ensure "Outline Variants" is turned on for the button colors you want to use.

## Changes From 3.x

In ACSS 4.0:

- Outline button border width is now unified with solid button border width, ensuring consistent button heights when solid and outline buttons are placed side by side.
