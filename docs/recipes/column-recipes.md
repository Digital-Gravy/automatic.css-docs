- `--col-min-width:` The minimum width a column can be before it stacks
- `--col-rule-style`: The style of the ruler between columns (solid, dotted, dashed, etc.)
- `--col-rule-width`: The thickness of the ruler between columns
- `--col-rule-color`: The color of the ruler between columns
- `--col-gap`: The gap between columns
- `--row-gap`: The gap between "rows" (added as margin to the child elements).
