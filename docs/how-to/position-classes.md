title: Position Classes
sidebar_position: 100
---

These classes set the position of an element, with the two options being:

- `.relative`
- [`.sticky`](https://automaticcss.com/docs/sticky-classes/)

**Note:** Turning off position classes will not turn off sticky classes as sticky classes have a separate options toggle.
