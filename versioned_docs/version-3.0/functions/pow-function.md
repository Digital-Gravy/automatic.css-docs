This function is used for exponentiation. It raises any number to the specified power.

```HTML
$my-pow: pow($my-text-size, 3);
```

If the value of `$my-text-size` is 2.4, this statement is the equivalent of 2.43.

This function is most often used in scale-based calculations.

**Result:** 13.824

We’ll continue updating this documentation if more functions become available.
