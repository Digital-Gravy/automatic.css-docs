Media query recipes will expand a media query for any custom code that you’d like. The best part is that you don’t have to know the value of the breakpoint – the recipe does all the work.

## Max-Width Media Queries

- `@breakpoint-xs`
- `@breakpoint-s`
- `@breakpoint-m`
- `@breakpoint-l`
- `@breakpoint-xl`
- `@breakpoint-xxl`

## Min-Width Media Queries

- `@breakpoint-up-xs`
- `@breakpoint-up-s`
- `@breakpoint-up-m`
- `@breakpoint-up-l`
- `@breakpoint-up-xl`
- `@breakpoint-up-xxl`
