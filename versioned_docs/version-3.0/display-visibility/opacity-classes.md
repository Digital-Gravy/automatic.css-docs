Opacity classes set the opacity of any element that accepts the opacity property.

Here’s an image with default opacity:

And here’s an image with `.opacity--50`:

Opacity classes follow the syntax `.opacity--[value]` with supported values from `10` to `90` in increments of five, as well as “`5`” and “`95`.
